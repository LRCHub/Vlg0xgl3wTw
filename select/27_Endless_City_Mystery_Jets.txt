Endless city I'm lost will you show me the way
Endless city I am barking up the wrong tree today
Endless city in my home in my horizon
But could I ever step off the treadmill that I'm moving along

Here
Where the people run on fear
You might disappear
Trying to survive

Endless city she's calling out across time zones
Where you can be never on your own but still always feel alone
Endless city she broke before she reached her dream
Oh to be the perfect cog in a perfect machine

Here
Where the people run on fear
You might disappear
Trying to survive
I'm wondering if the clouds will lift
In the endless city tonight

Been around town
Been up and down
I met with clever clowns
Oysters and crabs
Underpass hounds
Filthy red gowns
Different grounds
It's all around town

Filthy corners all around
Where our love was
Born out by your heels
I was following the sound
From the suburbs
This story here revealed
That now we have common ground
I still come 'round
And see if you're alright
We're still living but I found
We're just another sad song
Here in the endless city tonight

Been around town
Been up and down
I met with clever clowns
Oysters and crabs
Underpass hounds
Filthy red gowns
Different grounds
It's all around town

Been around town
Been up and down
I met with clever clowns
Oysters and crabs
Underpass hounds
Filthy red gowns
Different grounds
It's all around town

Been around town
Been up and down
I met with clever clowns
Oysters and crabs
Underpass hounds
Filthy red gowns
Different grounds
It's all around town
