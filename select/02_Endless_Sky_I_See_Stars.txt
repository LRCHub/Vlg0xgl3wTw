I'll take my stand and ask you all to fight
To come together as one, before they take our rights
You should have known from the start, that some day they'd try
And I told you before; you're all living a lie
Knowing the truth is like a different dimension:
There's no going back once you see the lies
I don't know about you
I will rise, I will rise, I will rise
This is our time, rise up
Stand your ground
We can conquer the king of the world
Take the time to open up your weary eyes
Are blind to all things around us.
This is our time, this our time
To set things right.
Get on your feet before it's too late
And tell everyone I know.
Sir can you please spare some change for me in this world today.
Where people fear the very power that's given to them.
You should have known from the start that some day we'd try.
I tried to tell you before: you're all living a lie.
Knowing the truth is like a different dimension:
There's no turning back once you hear the lies.
I don't know about you
I will rise, I will rise, I will rise
Take the time to open up your weary eyes
Are blind to all things around us.
This is our time, this our time
To set things right.
Get on your feet before it's too late
This is our time, this our time to set things right.
Allow me your undivided attention;
Let us bring you to the next dimension.
I am the alpha omega sent to expose your lies.
I am your God now.
We'll bring the end to them all.
We can conquer the king of the world.
