Well, I'm living in a shoebox on the corner of an endless road
And this city is as lonely as traffic.
I'm trying to get a hold.

'Cuz all my life I've been floating like a kite,
Twisting and turning in the wind,
And I just might be ready to come down.
So, I will fight to make you my ground.

Waking up to an inch of sunlight and another dream thats over.
Yeah, I do what I want but it never fills the hole of being sober.

'Cuz all my life I've been floating like a kite,
Twisting and turning in the wind,
And I just might be ready to come down.
So, I will fight to make you my ground.

High.

And the leaves fly right past my window,
Introduce the rain.
And there's nothing more here for me
In the cold embrace of the parade.

'Cuz all my life I've been floating like a kite,
Twisting and turning in the wind,
And I just might be ready to come down.
So, I will fight to make you my ground.

Yeah, I will fight to make you my ground.
