You say you're thirsty
You say you're searching
You say you're lonely
You say you're hurting
Well I'm hurting too
You sit here crying
You feel like dying
You say you're learning
You keep on turning
I'm turning too
You say you want me
You say you need me
You say you love me
I know you hate me
I hate you too
And are you writing?
You say you're writing
And are you giving?
You say you're living
And are you taking?
You say you're faking
You say you're drinking
You should be thinking
You stay out talking
You should be walking
You feel like crying
You say we're dying
You say you're hurting
I know you're hurting
You say it's early
It's never early
And are you sleeping?
You say you're sleeping
And are you dreaming?
You say you're breathing
I'm breathing too
You say it's easy
It's never easy
I run to you
